# General Rules

- Use Python with FastAPI for this project.
- Handle only one TaskMaster task or subtask at a time.
- Ask before proceeding to the next task.
- Include an OpenAPI spec (should be automatically provided with FastAPI)
- Ensure PEP8 compliance.
- The code should pass standard lint tests (eg: flake8 or similar).
- The code should pass bandit security analysis.
- Use Python type annotations.
- There is a Python 3.12 virtual environment in aweberenv.  Activate that before running any Python commands.
- When reviewing the project for the first time, always check the following:
  - Project structure and source code
  - Project configuration for tests, linters, formatters, pre-commit hooks, etc.
  - Current TaskMaster task status
  - git status

- For each TaskMaster task or subtask, do the following:
  1. First create an appropriate feature branch.
  2. Create a suite of automated tests (unit or functional) for that task.
  3. A task/subtask is not complete until all relevant tests are passing.
  4. Mark the related tasks and subtasks as complete.
  5. Commit the changes.  DO NOT COMMIT UNTIL ALL TESTS PASS.
  6. Merge feature branch back into main
  7. Delete feature branch
